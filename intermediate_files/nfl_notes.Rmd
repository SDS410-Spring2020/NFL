**touchback:** a ball one downs deliberately behind one's own goal line or that is kicked through one's end zone. It is taken to the 20-yard line to resume play.

**goal to go:** the situation in which an offensive team gets a first down within ten yards of the goal line, and thus cannot advance for another first down.
